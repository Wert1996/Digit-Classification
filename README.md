# Digit-Classification
Hand written implementation of Artifial neural net using `numpy`.
This is based on the online book by Michael Nielson at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ 
where it's used for the purpose of digit classification.

Artificial neural networks are computer systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task specific programming.
